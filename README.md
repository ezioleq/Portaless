## About
Portaless is a simple fangame made in Unity Engine for fun and experience.
It's featuring well known mechanics from Portal games (expect the portals itself), recreated prop models in their unique style
and maybe some original subtleties in the future.

### A brief history

This project started as my attempt to recreate the laser mechanics from Portal 2, but I started adding more elements and we ended up here.

See [Portal 2 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This project is not going to be a full grown game.**  
> I'd like to treat it like a prototype, sandbox, something where we can experiment with new entities,
> learn code, project scaling and maintenance. Please don't expect this project to be a game that you
> can play from start to finish.
